# Lab 7 ‚Äì Containerization of Python FastAPI and MySQL Database with CLI

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the integration of a RESTful **FastAPI web service** with a **MySQL relational database**, alongside a custom-built **Python CLI** and comprehensive **unit testing suite**. It showcases how web APIs can interact with both dynamic HTTP routes and static SQL queries to power full-stack applications.

---

## Description

The project includes:

- A **FastAPI server** with multiple routes that demonstrate working with query strings, path parameters, headers, cookies, and JSON bodies.
- A **MySQL database** (`my_guitar_shop`) containing realistic e-commerce data across tables such as `products`, `orders`, `customers`, and more.
- A **Python command-line interface (CLI)** that allows the user to interact with either API routes or database queries through a menu-driven terminal interface.
- A **unit testing suite** built with `unittest` to validate both the FastAPI routes and MySQL queries, ensuring correctness and coverage.

### Database: `my_guitar_shop`

The DB includes:

- `products`, `categories`
- `customers`, `addresses`
- `orders`, `order_items`
- `administrators`

### üß† Query Capabilities

- Single-table queries
- `INNER JOIN` with multiple relations
- `GROUP BY` on state, city, category, customer

These are tested through both the CLI and `unittest`.


## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- Python 3.9+ (for CLI and unit tests)
- MySQL client (optional for direct DB access)


### üê≥ Step 1: Start Docker Containers
